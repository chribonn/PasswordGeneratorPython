This utility will allow you to generate a password based on the symbol sets you specify and desired length.

The password is copied to the clipboard for easy pasting.

| Force 1st char as number / letter | The first character of the password cannot be a symbol            |
| Avoid confusing characters        | The password will not include the following [lIO01]               |

The Generate Password button is used to produce a new password.

On Windows and Mac systems the generated passwords are automatically copied to the clipboard making the copy icon redundant.
On Linux systems a **Not implemented error** could be thrown.  The utility should work around this limitation.  For information on how to install this functionality visit pyperclip's page at [Welcome to Pyperclipâ€™s documentation!](https://pyperclip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
